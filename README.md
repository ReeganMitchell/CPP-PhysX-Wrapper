# CPP-PhysX-Wrapper
A custom wrapper/helper class I made for my team project to integrate PhysX into an existing codebase.

This allows for others that are developing our team project to work on the existing codebase without having to learn how to program with PhysX, instead they can call the functions that are in PhysXSystem.cpp

Documentation can be found in the "8508 PhysX Documentation" file or at:
